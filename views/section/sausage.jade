          Sausage making is building features and fixes by completing micro-tasks.  
          These micro-tasks take the form of commits made to a feature branch.

        h5 Downsides to sausage making:
        ul
            li Cherry-picking is difficult
            li Assume unstable until merged (sausages aren't exactly pretty)
            li More time added to development upfront
            li Can mislead commit detectives
            li Makes you think about what you just did :P

            li(class="").
                Create a goal for your next commit.  Try not to do anything outside that
                goal.
            li(class="fragment"). 
                Clean up messes with reverts.  Don't sweep under the rug by rewriting history
            li(class="fragment"). 
                Any moving, renaming, or deleting of files should be in their own
