            Commit as much as possible
        p.
            Git cannot protect you unless you commit.  You are by all means welcome
            to not publish anything until you're done, but commit before pursuing
            new tasks.

            Do not  <code> git reset --hard</code> <small>(Sorry)</small>
        p.
            Instead use <code>git checkout -b &lt;experimental_branch_name&gt;</code>
        p.
            OR
        p

                <code>git stash</code>

            Release tags &mdash; not branches
        p(class="fragment").
            Tags and branches both point at commits, but tags cannot "move forward".
            This means you always have a clear understanding of what is deployed.

            Do not force-push

            Seriously, don't force-push

            Alright, you can force-push
    section
        div.
            What are some reasons for force-pushing?
        ul
            li(class="fragment") You've push sensitive data to the repository &mdash; a simple revert won't erase history
            li(class="fragment") That's it.
        p(class="fragment").
            If you come up with any others, record your findings in <code>/dev/null</code>
    section
        div.
            How to properly force-push:
        ul
            li(class="fragment") Let the team know prior to pushing.  Everyone will be unavoidably be affected especially if working on the same branch.
            li(class="fragment").
                Make sure no commits will be lost
            li(class="fragment").
                Make sure all branches checked out from the updated branch are also
                updated afterwards.

            How to recover from a force-push
    section
        p.
            All force-pushes will spit out a similar message
        pre
            code.
                To user@host:repo.git
                + abcdef0...1234567 HEAD -> branchname (forced update)
        p(class="fragment").
            <code>abcdef0</code> refers to the previous commit your HEAD was pointing
            at.  By checking it out, you can restore the state of the repostory prior
            to force-pushing.
        pre(class="fragment")
            code.
                git checkout abcdef0
                git push -f
