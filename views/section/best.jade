            Release tags &mdash; not branches
        p(class="fragment").
            Tags and branches both point at commits, but tags cannot "move forward".  
            This means you always have a clear understanding of what is deployed.

            Do not force-push
    section

            Seriously, don't force-push

            Alright, you can force-push
    section
        div.
            What are some reasons for force-pushing?
        ul
            li(class="fragment") You've push sensitive data to the repository &mdash; a simple revert won't erase history
            li(class="fragment") That's it.
        p(class="fragment").
            If you come up with any others, record your findings in <code>/dev/null</code>
    section
        div.
            How to properly force-push:
        ul
            li(class="fragment") Let the team know prior to pushing.  Everyone will be unavoidably be affected especially if working on the same branch.
            li(class="fragment"). 
                Make sure no commits will be lost
            li(class="fragment").
                Make sure all branches checked out from the updated branch are also
                updated afterwards.

            How to recover from a force-push
    section
        p.
            All force-pushes will spit out a similar message
        pre
            code.
                To user@host:repo.git
                + abcdef0...1234567 HEAD -> branchname (forced update)
        p(class="fragment").
            <code>abcdef0</code> refers to the previous commit your HEAD was pointing
            at.  By checking it out, you can restore the state of the repostory prior
            to force-pushing.
        pre(class="fragment")
            code.
                git checkout abcdef0
                git push -f
